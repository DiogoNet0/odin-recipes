    <p>This recipe for teriyaki chicken noodle soup is an easy, intuitive way to liven up a classic chicken noodle soup. Marinate and sear juicy chicken thighs, then reuse that flavorful teriyaki-style sauce to build up a rich, hearty broth. I love all the textures in this soup: wide udon noodles and crisp-tender bok choy beautifully balance the rich teriyaki flavors.</p>
    <h3>What Does Teriyaki Mean?</h3>
    <p>The meaning of teriyaki refers to a Japanese method of cooking that combines grilling (“yaki”) with glaze (“teri” meaning “shine”). Traditionally, teriyaki requires grilling a protein like fish with a glaze of soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and sugar. This recipe incorporates fresh ginger and garlic into a quick chicken marinade. By reserving the marinade and thickening it with chopped spring onions, we’re able to build up a flavorful, aromatic soup base.</p>
    <h3>A Tip for Cooking Bok Choy</h3>
    <p>When adding the bok choy, try to submerge the stalks in the broth, buoyed by chicken pieces, and let the green parts float on the surface; the greens will steam slightly while the stalks boil for an evenly boiled texture.</p>
    <h3><b>Ingredients:</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup lower-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mirin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger (from one 5-inch piece)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated garlic (from 4 medium cloves)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 (7.1-ounce) packages instant udon noodles</li>
        <li>4 medium scallions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grapeseed oil, divided</li>
        <li>6 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 bunches baby bok choy, separated into individual leaves</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced baby bella or crimini mushrooms</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Method</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken:</li>
        <p>Stir together the soy sauce, sugar, mirin, ginger, and garlic in a large bowl. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes or up to 1 hour (beyond that, the high concentration of soy sauce can affect the texture of the chicken).</p>

        <li>Brown the marinated chicken:</li>
        <p>Remove the chicken from the refrigerator. Set a colander or large strainer over a bowl and drain, allowing the excess to drip off. Reserve 1/4 cup marinade; discard remaining marinade. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown on both sides and a thermometer inserted into the chicken registers 165°F, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a medium bowl.</p>

        <li>Build the broth:</li>
        <p>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Add the chopped white and pale green scallions; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and translucent, about 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup reserved marinade to the Dutch oven. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the broth, stirring constantly, until combined. Bring to a boil over high.</p>

        <li>Shred the chicken:</li>
        <p>While the broth is coming to a boil, shred the chicken into bite-size pieces using two forks. Add the shredded chicken and its accumulated juices to the Dutch oven and bring back to a simmer over medium.</p>

        <li>Cook the bok choy and mushrooms:</li>
