    <p>These fluffernutter brownies have a reputation that goes back over a decade. When I was a kid, my school had an annual charity festival that included bake sales, music, games, and all sorts of fun activities put on by the students. Every year, I contributed to the bake sale. Fluffernutter brownies were always the first item to sell out, and they became my signature recipe. I have been making them ever since. </p>
    <p>As a kid, I absolutely loved a toasted fluffernutter sandwich, and my obsession with a classic indulgent chocolate brownie goes way back. This recipe pairs a bittersweet chocolate brownie with salty, nutty peanut butter and sweet and chewy marshmallow fluff. The flavors and textures of fluffernutter brownies are satisfying in every single bite. </p>
    <p>My fluffernutter brownies take less than an hour to make start to finish, making them an easy sweet treat to bake during the week. But be warned: you need real patience to let them cool down completely before slicing—otherwise, you won’t get neat, clean cuts. </p>
    <h3>Using a Boxed Brownie Mix</h3>
    <p>This is a decadent chocolate brownie recipe that uses melted chocolate and cocoa powder to enhance that flavor. Instead of making it from scratch, you can use a boxed brownie mix as a shortcut. This recipe works well with a fudge brownie or a cake brownie mix, prepared according to the package. </p>
    <h3>Tips for the Perfect Fluffernutter Brownie</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Beat the eggs and sugars until pale and creamy. This ensures a crunchy top on the brownies once baked.</li>
        <li>Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients gently, as we don’t want to knock out all that air from the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Don't over-swirl the peanut butter and marshmallow fluff into the brownie batter or else you will lose the distinct, pretty pattern.</li>
        <li>For clean edges, don’t slice the brownies until they have completely cooled down.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Ingredients:</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter </li>
        <li>6 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (133g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (160g) packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (150g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder</li>
        <li>Pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup marshmallow fluff</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Method</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
        <p>Stir together the soy sauce, sugar, mirin, ginger, and garlic in a large bowl. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes or up to 1 hour (beyond that, the high concentration of soy sauce can affect the texture of the chicken).</p>

        <li>Brown the marinated chicken:</li>
        <p>Remove the chicken from the refrigerator. Set a colander or large strainer over a bowl and drain, allowing the excess to drip off. Reserve 1/4 cup marinade; discard remaining marinade. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown on both sides and a thermometer inserted into the chicken registers 165°F, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a medium bowl.</p>

        <li>Build the broth:</li>
        <p>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Add the chopped white and pale green scallions; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and translucent, about 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup reserved marinade to the Dutch oven. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the broth, stirring constantly, until combined. Bring to a boil over high.</p>

        <li>Shred the chicken:</li>
        <p>While the broth is coming to a boil, shred the chicken into bite-size pieces using two forks. Add the shredded chicken and its accumulated juices to the Dutch oven and bring back to a simmer over medium.</p>

        <li>Add the noodles and serve:</li>
        <p>Add the cooked noodles to the Dutch oven and stir to combine. Divide the soup among 4 bowls, sprinkle with the dark green scallions, and serve. You can store the soup in an airtight container for up to 4 days, or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
